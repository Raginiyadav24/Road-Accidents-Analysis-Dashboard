# Road-Accidents-Analysis-Dashboard
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of road accident data using Microsoft Excel.
The objective is to analyze accident patterns based on severity, time, location, road conditions, weather, vehicle type, and casualties, and present insights through an interactive Excel dashboard.

The dashboard helps stakeholders understand risk factors, accident trends, and high-impact conditions, enabling data-driven decision making for road safety improvements.

##📌 Key KPI Questions – Road Accidents Analysis Dashboard

- What is the total number of road accidents, casualties, and vehicles involved, and what is the average casualty rate per accident?
- How are road accidents distributed across severity levels (Fatal, Serious, Slight), and which severity contributes the highest number of casualties?
- How do accident frequency and severity differ between Urban and Rural areas, and which area records a higher casualty rate?
- Which vehicle types are most frequently involved in accidents, and which contribute the most to serious and fatal incidents?
- How do weather conditions impact accident occurrence and severity, and do most accidents happen in fine or adverse weather conditions?
- What is the effect of light conditions (daylight vs darkness) on accident frequency and severity?
- Which road types and road surface conditions record the highest number of accidents and casualties?
- Which districts or locations report the highest accident counts, and are certain areas consistently associated with higher-severity accidents?
- What combinations of vehicle type, road condition, and weather create the highest accident risk?
- What key factors most strongly influence accident severity and casualty outcomes based on the overall analysis?
