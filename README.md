# Road-Accidents-Analysis-Dashboard
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of road accident data using Microsoft Excel.
The objective is to analyze accident patterns based on severity, time, location, road conditions, weather, vehicle type, and casualties, and present insights through an interactive Excel dashboard.

The dashboard helps stakeholders understand risk factors, accident trends, and high-impact conditions, enabling data-driven decision making for road safety improvements.

##📌 Key KPI Questions – Road Accidents Analysis Dashboard

- What is the total number of road accidents, casualties, and vehicles involved, and what is the average casualty rate per accident?
- How are road accidents distributed across severity levels (Fatal, Serious, Slight), and which severity contributes the highest number of casualties?
- How do accident frequency and severity differ between Urban and Rural areas, and which area records a higher casualty rate?
- Which vehicle types are most frequently involved in accidents, and which contribute the most to serious and fatal incidents?
- How do weather conditions impact accident occurrence and severity, and do most accidents happen in fine or adverse weather conditions?
- What is the effect of light conditions (daylight vs darkness) on accident frequency and severity?
- Which road types and road surface conditions record the highest number of accidents and casualties?
- Which districts or locations report the highest accident counts, and are certain areas consistently associated with higher-severity accidents?
- What combinations of vehicle type, road condition, and weather create the highest accident risk?
- What key factors most strongly influence accident severity and casualty outcomes based on the overall analysis?

## Process
This project analyzes road accident data to convert raw records into actionable insights using Microsoft Excel. The process began with problem definition and data understanding, followed by thorough data cleaning using TRIM, CLEAN, SUBSTITUTE, and IFERROR to ensure accuracy and consistency. Cleaned data was transformed to create key metrics such as total accidents, casualties, vehicles involved, and average casualties per accident. Exploratory analysis was performed through Pivot Tables to study severity, vehicle involvement, urban–rural patterns, environmental conditions, and location risks. Key KPIs were defined and mapped to calculations. An interactive dashboard was designed using KPI cards, charts, and slicers for dynamic filtering. Automation and refresh ensured scalability. The final dashboard highlights high-risk factors, supports data-driven road safety decisions, and demonstrates skills.

## 📊 Project Insights – Road Accidents Analysis Dashboard

- Urban areas report a significantly higher number of road accidents compared to rural areas, indicating higher traffic density and exposure risk in urban regions.
- Cars and two-wheelers are involved in the majority of accidents, making them the most vulnerable vehicle categories in road safety analysis.
- Although adverse weather contributes to accidents, a large proportion of accidents occur during fine weather, suggesting that human behavior and traffic volume are major contributing factors.
- Daylight conditions record more accidents than darkness, highlighting that accident frequency is influenced more by traffic volume than visibility alone.
- Serious and fatal accidents contribute disproportionately to total casualties, even though they occur less frequently than slight accidents.
- Certain road types and road surface conditions consistently show higher casualty counts, indicating infrastructure-related risk factors.
- Specific districts show repeated high accident concentrations, identifying them as priority areas for targeted safety interventions.
- Accident severity is not driven by a single factor but by a combination of vehicle type, road condition, weather, and location.

## 🎯 Insight Summary

The analysis reveals that traffic density, vehicle type, and road infrastructure play a more critical role in accident severity than weather alone. These insights can help authorities prioritize urban traffic management, vehicle safety awareness, and infrastructure improvements.
